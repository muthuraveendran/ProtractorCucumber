/**
 * @desc
 *  Extracts the part of the string between the `startIndex` and `endIndex` indexes, or to the end of the string if `endIndex` is `undefined`.
 *
 * @param {Answerable<number>} startIndex
 *  The zero-based index at which to begin extraction.
 *
 *  If negative, it is treated as `str.length + startIndex`. For example, if `startIndex` is `-3`, it is treated as `str.length - 3`
 *
 *  If `startIndex` is greater than or equal to `str.length`, an empty string is returned.
 *
 * @param {Answerable<number>} [endIndex]
 *  The zero-based index _before_ which to endIndex extraction.
 *  The character at this index will not be included.
 *
 *  If `endIndex` is omitted or undefined, or greater than `str.length`,
 *  `slice()` extracts to the endIndex of the string.
 *
 *  If negative, it is treated as `str.length + endIndex`.
 *  For example, if `endIndex` is `-3`, it is treated as `str.length - 3`.
 *
 * @returns {AnswerMappingFunction<string, string>}
