 *
 *  This function is an alias for {@link Serenity#engage},
 *  which provides an alternative to calling {@link Actor#whoCan}
 *  directly in your tests and is typically invoked in a "before all"
 *  or "before each" hook of your test runner of choice.
 *
 *  If your implementation of the {@link Cast} interface is stateless,
 *  you can invoke this function once before your entire test suite is executed, see
 *  - [`beforeAll`](https://jasmine.github.io/api/3.6/global.html#beforeAll) in Jasmine,
 *  - [`before`](https://mochajs.org/#hooks) in Mocha,
 *  - [`BeforeAll`](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/blob/master/docs/support_files/hooks.md#beforeall--afterall) in Cucumber.js
 *
 *  However, if your {@link Cast} holds state that you want reset before each scenario,
 *  it's better to invoke `engage` before each test using:
 *  - [`beforeEach`](https://jasmine.github.io/api/3.6/global.html#beforeEach) in Jasmine
 *  - [`beforeEach`](https://mochajs.org/#hooks) in Mocha,
 *  - [`Before`](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/blob/master/docs/support_files/hooks.md#hooks) in Cucumber.js
